# QSIS-16

Site is live! On https://qsis.404d.cf/

Got bored, made a custom ISA, emulator and assembler. Ideally simple enough to possibly be used as an educational resource?

## DIY
Running this project requires Rust. Use `cargo build --bin emu --bin ass` to get assembler and emulator binaries
(the emulator provides some useful debugging features like dumping registers and memory). Use `cargo build --bin web` for a binary for the web server,
though compiling takes a significant amount of time.

Changelog and future goals can be found on the production site.
